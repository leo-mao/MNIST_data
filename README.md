# MNIST_data

The MNIST dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The MNIST dataset is required when beginners write the `hello world` program in ML. However, many of them in china suffer from the unstable `Internet` connection caused by the strict network censorship when trying download this dataset from the offcial site. To remove the obstacle, I mirror them to github.
